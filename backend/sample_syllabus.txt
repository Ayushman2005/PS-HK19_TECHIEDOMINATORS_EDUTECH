PHYSICS SYLLABUS — CLASS 11 & 12
Chapter 1: Laws of Motion

Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):
A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. This property is called inertia. Heavier objects have more inertia.

Newton's Second Law of Motion:
The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force.
F = ma (Force = mass × acceleration)
Unit of force: Newton (N) = kg·m/s²
Example: A 5 kg object accelerates at 3 m/s² when force F = 5 × 3 = 15 N is applied.

Newton's Third Law of Motion:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs. If A exerts force on B, then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A.
Example: When you push a wall, the wall pushes you back with equal force.

Chapter 2: Gravitation

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:
Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
F = G × (m1 × m2) / r²
G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg² (Universal Gravitational Constant)

Acceleration due to gravity (g):
g = GM/R² where M is mass of Earth, R is radius of Earth
g ≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth's surface
g decreases with altitude: g' = g(1 - 2h/R) for small heights h

Kepler's Laws:
1. Law of Orbits: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
2. Law of Areas: The line joining a planet and Sun sweeps equal areas in equal time intervals.
3. Law of Periods: T² ∝ r³ where T is orbital period and r is semi-major axis.

Chapter 3: Thermodynamics

Zeroth Law: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This defines temperature.

First Law: ΔU = Q - W
ΔU = change in internal energy, Q = heat added, W = work done by system
Energy is conserved. Heat added to a system equals increase in internal energy plus work done by the system.

Second Law: Heat flows spontaneously from a hot body to a cold body, never the reverse without external work. Entropy of an isolated system always increases.

Thermodynamic Processes:
- Isothermal: constant temperature, PV = constant
- Adiabatic: no heat exchange, PV^γ = constant (γ = Cp/Cv)
- Isochoric: constant volume, Q = ΔU
- Isobaric: constant pressure, Q = nCpΔT

Chapter 4: Waves and Oscillations

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):
Motion where restoring force is proportional and opposite to displacement.
F = -kx, a = -ω²x
Period: T = 2π√(m/k) for spring-mass system
Period of simple pendulum: T = 2π√(L/g)
Displacement: x = A·sin(ωt + φ)
where A = amplitude, ω = angular frequency, φ = initial phase

Wave Properties:
- Wavelength (λ): distance between successive crests
- Frequency (f): oscillations per second (Hz)
- Speed: v = fλ
- Amplitude: maximum displacement from equilibrium
- Time Period: T = 1/f

Chapter 5: Electricity and Magnetism

Ohm's Law: V = IR (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
Resistance: R = ρL/A where ρ = resistivity, L = length, A = cross-section area

Kirchhoff's Laws:
- KCL: Sum of currents at a junction = 0
- KVL: Sum of voltages around a closed loop = 0

Capacitors: C = Q/V, Energy = ½CV²
In series: 1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2
In parallel: C = C1 + C2

Magnetic Force on a charge: F = qv × B = qvB·sinθ
Faraday's Law: EMF = -dΦ/dt (rate of change of magnetic flux)
Lenz's Law: Induced current opposes the change causing it.

Chapter 1: Calculus — Differentiation

Derivative: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

Basic Rules:
- Power Rule: d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹
- Product Rule: d/dx(uv) = u·v' + v·u'
- Quotient Rule: d/dx(u/v) = (v·u' - u·v') / v²
- Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)

Common Derivatives:
- d/dx(sin x) = cos x
- d/dx(cos x) = -sin x
- d/dx(eˣ) = eˣ
- d/dx(ln x) = 1/x

Applications:
- Finding maxima/minima: set f'(x) = 0, check f''(x)
- If f''(x) > 0: local minimum
- If f''(x) < 0: local maximum

Chapter 2: Integration

Integration is the reverse of differentiation (antiderivative).
∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C (n ≠ -1)
∫sin x dx = -cos x + C
∫cos x dx = sin x + C
∫eˣ dx = eˣ + C
∫(1/x) dx = ln|x| + C

Definite Integral: ∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
Area under curve between x=a and x=b = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx

Chapter 3: Matrices and Determinants

Matrix multiplication: (AB)ᵢⱼ = Σ Aᵢₖ · Bₖⱼ
Determinant of 2×2: |A| = ad - bc for [[a,b],[c,d]]
Inverse: A⁻¹ = adj(A) / det(A), exists only if det(A) ≠ 0

Chapter 4: Probability

P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)  [Conditional Probability]
Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)·P(A) / P(B)

Binomial Distribution: P(X=r) = ⁿCᵣ · pʳ · (1-p)ⁿ⁻ʳ
Mean = np, Variance = np(1-p)
